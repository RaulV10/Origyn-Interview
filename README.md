## What does this project do?:

  - Returns a pre builded list of *things to do* from Motoko
  - Shows that list on a React component
  - You can add a new *thing to do* to the list
  - You can filter the list based on *Everything*, *Completed* and *Unfinished*

**Note: You are not allowed to mark as *complete* any element within the list, just to add a new one**

The project was made using Typescript
